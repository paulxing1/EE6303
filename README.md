java c 2024/25 Semester 1 EE6303: Electromagnetic Compatibility Design Home Assignment Submission Deadline: 8 Oct 2024 (Tuesday)Figure 1 shows a carbon resistor with two parallel copper leads. The length of each lead is 50 mm and the centre-to-centre  separation  distance between leads is 5 mm. The diameter of the lead is 0.5 mm. Conductivity of Copper σ = 5.82×107  s/m. (a) Assume that the inductance and capacitance of the copper leads are the only parasitic inductance and capacitance. The resistance of the leads is too small that it can be neglected. For the calculation of the parasitic inductance, you can assume that there will be skin effect 代 写EE6303: Electromagnetic Compatibility Design 2024/25 Semester 1Matlab 代做程序编程语言in the copper leads. Draw the equivalent circuit model looking into x-y. Clearly indicate the values of resistance, inductance and capacitance.    (30 Marks) (b) If the value of the resistor is 120 Ω, plot the impedance magnitude versus frequency from 10 kHz to 1 GHz (use log-scale for both vertical and horizontal axes) using any software tools available to you (MATLAB, LTSPICE or MS Excel).   (30 Marks) (c) Repeat part (b) if the value of the resistor is 680 kΩ .   (30 Marks) (d) What is your observation by comparing the impedance magnitude responses in parts (b) and (c).   (10 Marks)
